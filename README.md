Investigate a dataset - No Show Appointments

This is the first of three projects completed for Udacity's 
Data Analyst Nanodegree programme. It is not meant to be a 
deep dive into the dataset but a showcase of basic use of:
Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, and communicating results.

Of the three available datasets provided by Udacity I chose
to look at the "No-show appointments" dataset as I suspected
it would contain the least industry specific jargon.
